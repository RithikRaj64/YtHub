YtHub is a web app that allows you to convert YouTube video links to either video or MP3 format.

## Features

- Convert YouTube video links to either video or MP3 format
- Two pages for video and MP3 conversion

## Usage

To use YtHub, simply navigate to the appropriate page for the type of conversion you want to perform. Once there, enter the YouTube video link and click the "Convert" button. The converted file will then be available for download.

While converting to audio, the default file type is WebM. This is because WebM is a royalty-free format, whereas MP3 is not. If you want to convert to MP3, you can do so by going to the WebM to MP3 converter page.
